# Library Template
Basic template for both a sensor/IC library or a peripheral / hardware library, used for most sensors or microcontrollers that I encounter.

These libraries also support a basic interface, to make it easier to connect sensor libraries to peripheral libraries of different controllers, without the need of modifying the libraries source code. More details can be found in [the interface documentation.](/INTERFACE.md)
